# ENIM Custom Entity Model Format
As you may know, entity models were hinted for 1.9, then (most likely) scrapped. So, I have taken it upon myself to create a working customizable entity model system as a mod. The ENIM entity model system aims to provide customizable entity models that can be animated with custom animations under a variety of circumstances (as permitted by the game). Entities, tile entities, and items can be modelled under the ENIM model system.

Documentation for various features can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/kvverti/enim/wiki).
